### Group A - No. 1

Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers.

### Group A - No. 4

To create ADT that implement the "set" concept.

a. Add (newElement) - Place a value into the set
b. Remove (element) - Remove the value
c. Contains (element) - Return true if element is in collection
d. Size () - Return number of values in collection, Iterator () - Return an iterator used to loop
over collection
e. Intersection of two sets
f. Union of two sets
g. Difference between two sets
h. Subset

### Group B - No. 5

A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.

### Group B - No. 6

Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
i. Insert new node
ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root
iii. Minimum data value found in the tree
iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
v. Search a value
